# FLEX_PCB_ELECTRICAL_TEST
2025 Bachelor's project at HVL with the ATLAS group in UIB, in coordination with UIO.  
This repository is dedicated to the electrical testing part of the quality control testing for the FLEX PCBs.

## Test Procedure
### Step 1: Select correct adapter board
Identify the adapter board by name and PCB outline.
### Step 2: Connect the 40-pin cable
Make sure the locks on either side of the connector are fully open.
Line the notchs up with eachother and press down until the locks close fully
Make sure the cable is properly connected
### Step 3: Connect the high-voltage cable
Press the cable all the way into the connector there is not lock.
Dosnt matter which direction you plug it in by.
### Step 4: Prepare the work area and ESD protection
Keep the area clean and dry.
Wear antistatic nitrile gloves.
Handle PCBs with care
### Step 5: Unpack the PCB from its antistatic bag and place the PCB in the adapter board.
Avoid contact with conductive traces and sensitive components.
Do not bend the board or use excessive force.
Follow the outline for correct positioning.
Use plastic tools if necessary.
### Step 6: Koble til b√•ndkablene (3 stk)
#### Middle cable:
Open the ribben connector.
Insert the cable and close the lock.
#### Outer cables:
Adjust and gently press down on the connectors.
### Step 7: Start the script from terminal or IDE.
Enter PCB ID
Use barcode scanner or enter manually.
The script performs Resistance Tests and Current Leakage Tests.
Results are saved automatically.
### Step 8: Disconnect PCB
Wear antistatic gloves.
Carefully detach the two outer ribbon cables.
Open the middle latch and pull the PCB straight out (do not bend).
### Step 9: Store PCB
Place PCB back in the antistatic bag.
### Step 10: Disconnect adapter board if necessary
Disconnect high voltage cable first.
Open the latches on the 40-pin connector and pull the cable straight up.

## Ready for the next test.

# FLEX_PCB_ELECTRICAL_TEST
2025 Bachelor's project at HVL with the ATLAS group in UIB, in coordination with UIO.  
This repository is dedicated to the electrical testing part of the quality control testing for the FLEX PCBs.

## Test Procedure
### Step 1: Select correct adapter board
Identify the adapter board by name and PCB outline.
### Step 2: Connect the 40-pin cable
Make sure the locks on both sides of the connector are fully open.
Line up the notches and press down until the locks are fully closed.
Make sure the cable is properly connected with no gap between.
### Step 3: Connect the high-voltage cable
Press the cable all the way into the connector, there is no lock.
The direction which you connect it by does not matter.
### Step 4: Prepare the work area and ESD protection
Keep the area clean and dry.
Wear antistatic nitrile gloves.
Handle PCBs with care.
### Step 5: Unpack the PCB from its antistatic bag and place the PCB on the adapter board.
Avoid contact with conductive traces and sensitive components.
Do not bend the board or use excessive force (very little force is needed).
Follow the outline for correct positioning.
Use plastic tools if necessary.
### Step 6: Connect three ribbon cables
#### Middle cable:
Open the ribbon connector.
Insert the cable without closing the connector.
#### Outer cables:
While middle connector is loosely attached, adjust and gently press down the two side-connectors.
#### Middle cable:
Assure middle cable is properly inserted and close the lock.
### Step 7: Start the script from terminal or IDE.
Enter PCB ID by scanning the barcode or enter it manually.
The script performs Resistance Tests and Current Leakage Tests.
Results are saved automatically.
### Step 8: Disconnect PCB
Wear antistatic gloves.
Carefully detach the two outer ribbon cables.
Open the middle latch and pull the PCB straight out (do not bend).
### Step 9: Store PCB
Place PCB back in the antistatic bag.
### Step 10: Disconnect adapter board if necessary
Disconnect high voltage cable first.
Open the latches on the 40-pin connector and pull the cable straight up.

## Ready for the next test.
